### Data augmentation
I have successfully applied the augmentation, though the accuracy may not be improved significantly, while the loss and the training accuracy do not increase that high than before. Therefore, I think it prevents the overfitting here, which is kind of an improvement. 

Also, I have tried to train for some longer epochs, since overfitting is less significant. However, it takes a little bit longer time, I cannot make some conclusions by now. In my opinion, most of the training time is wasted on data transfering or copying. Maybe we could apply a deeper and more recent model to get more accuracy and make more use of good GPUs, since my GPU did not even sweat during training.
